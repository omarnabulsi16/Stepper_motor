# Stepper Motor

This is a software that will use a Raspberry Pi to control a stepper motor to position an directional antenna at a specific target to maximize signal strength.

Prerequiments for running this software: You are expected to have ROS and an appropriate GPS coordinate topic ready to implement. For hardware you need a raspberry pi and any stepper motor wired to the pins listed (4,11,17). You will upload the code provided in the repo onto the pi and make adjustments based on your IP address and websocket used.
